# SOLID
## S (SRP) - Single Responsibility Principle
- Every class should have only one reason to change
  - A function or class should be responsible for only one task (or responsibiliity)
    - Gather together the things that change for the same reason and separate things that change for different reasons.
       - Keep **ONLY** related stuff together
## O (OCP) - Open Close Principle
 - software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification
## L (LSP) - Liskov Substitution Principle
## I (ISP) - Interface Segregation Principle
## D (DIP) - Dependency Inversion Principle
