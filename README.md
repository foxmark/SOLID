# SOLID
## S (SRP) - Single Responsibility Principle
- Class should have only one reason to change
  - A function or class should be responsible for only one task (or responsibiliity)
    - Gather together the things that change for the same reason and separate things that change for different reasons.
       - Keep **ONLY** related stuff together
## O (OCP) - Open Close Principle
- Class should be open for extension but closed for modification
  - You should be able to chnage what a class does, without changing its code.
    - **Try** to imagine the future changes you will most likely need to make and designe the class to allow these changes without needing to modify the class itself.
## L (LSP) - Liskov Substitution Principle
## I (ISP) - Interface Segregation Principle
## D (DIP) - Dependency Inversion Principle
